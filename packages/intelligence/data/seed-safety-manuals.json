    "content": "EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES FOR PUMP STATIONS\n\nPurpose: This procedure establishes the steps required to safely shut down pump stations during emergency situations including equipment failure, flooding, fire, or power loss.\n\nScope: Applies to all pump stations including P-104, P-105, P-201, and P-301.\n\nIMEDIATE ACTIONS:\n\n1. ALARM ACKNOWLEDGMENT\n- Acknowledge all SCADA alarms immediately\n- Notify Central Control Room of emergency condition\n- Activate emergency lighting if required\n\n2. ASSESS THE SITUATION\n- Identify the nature of emergency (mechanical failure, electrical fault, flooding, fire)\n- Determine if immediate evacuation is required\n- Check for personnel injuries or hazards\n\n3. EMERGENCY STOP PROCEDURE\n- Press red EMERGENCY STOP button on control panel\n- Pumps will stop immediately (no controlled ramp-down)\n- All motor starters will open\n- Generator auto-start will activate if configured\n\n4. ELECTRICAL ISOLATION\n- Open main disconnect switch at panel C-701\n- Verify all motors have stopped rotation\n- Check motor temperatures - allow 30 minutes cooling before restart\n- Post \"DO NOT OPERATE\" tags on all disconnects\n\n5. MECHANICAL ISOLATION\n- Close suction valve V-401 if pump failure occurred\n- Open bypass valves if available to maintain service\n- Check for vibration, unusual noise, or leaks\n- Document pump hour meter readings\n\nWARNING: Never attempt to restart pumps until root cause is identified and corrected. Pumps running dry or with mechanical failure can cause catastrophic damage within seconds.\n\n6. NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS\n- Notify Water Operations Supervisor: John Martinez (555-0104)\n- For after-hours: Call emergency on-call rotation\n- Notify Maintenance if mechanical failure suspected\n- Document all actions in shift log\n\n7. SYSTEM MONITORING\n- Monitor system pressure via SCADA\n- Check storage tank levels (T-401, T-402)\n- Activate backup pump P-105 if P-104 failed\n- Ensure distribution system maintains minimum 35 PSI\n\nDO NOT RESTART until authorized by Operations Supervisor and root cause is resolved.\n\nRelated Documents: SOP-PUMP-001, LOTO-PUMP-003\nRevision: 3.2\nEffective Date: 2024-01-15",
